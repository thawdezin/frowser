![Frowser Logo](<>)

**Thaw De Zin's version of Flutter Browser App (Frowser)**

Frowser is a full-featured mobile browser created using Flutter and the flutter_inappwebview plugin. It offers a similar experience to the Google Chrome mobile browser but is open-source and highly customizable.

## Features

- **WebView Tab:** Frowser includes WebView tabs with custom long-press link/image previews. You can easily switch between tabs without losing your browsing state.

- **Browser App Bar:** The app features a browser app bar displaying the current URL and offering various popup menu actions. These actions include opening a new tab, incognito mode, saving URLs to favorites, offline page saving, SSL certificate viewing, enabling Desktop Mode, and more.

- **Developer Console:** Frowser provides a developer console where you can execute JavaScript code, view network information, and manage browser storage settings.

- **Settings Page:** Customize your browsing experience with the settings page. Adjust general browser settings and enable/disable specific features offered by the flutter_inappwebview for each WebView Tab.

- **Save and Restore State:** Frowser allows you to save and restore your current browser state, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.
